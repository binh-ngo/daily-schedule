# daily-schedule

## Description
I created a program that allows the user to manage their daily schedule. Hour blocks are colored based on their relationship to the current time of the local machine (which is shown at the top of the page) that the user is using. If the time-block is in the past, it is colored grey. If it's currently that time, it is colored red. Finally, if the time-block has not been reached yet, it is colored green. The user is able to type what they need to do during the specific time-blocks ad they can save it to the local storage after clicking the provided button. The program then retrieves the task from the local storage so the burden of remembering the tasks is solely the computer's responsibility.
